        Orb is a decentralized identifier (DID) method based on a federated and replicated Verifiable Data Registry (VDR).
        The decentralized network consists of servers that write, monitor, witness, and propogate batches of DID operations.
        The batches form a graph that is propogated and replicated between the servers as content-addressable objects.
        These content-addressable objects can be located via both domain and distributed hash table (DHT) mechanisms.
        Each witness server observes a subset of batches in the graph and includes them in their append-only logs (as Merkle Trees).
        The servers coordinate by propogating batches of DID operations and by monitoring the applicable witness servers' append-only logs.
        The Orb servers form a decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain for coordination.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document specifies the Orb DID Method along with a data model and rules for representing a graph of batches, 
        the Orb server API, a registry of protocol versions and parameters,
        an [[[activitystreams-core]]] vocabulary and an [[[activitypub]]] profile for propogating batches,
        a [[[rfc7033]]] profile for discovering endpoints, a [[[sidetree]]] protocol profile for encoding DID operations,
        and a [[[rfc6962]]] profile for witness logs.
