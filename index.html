        Orb is a decentralized identifier (DID) method based on a federated and replicated
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a> (VDR).
        The decentralized network consists of Orb servers that write, monitor, witness, and propagate batches of DID operations.
        The batches form a graph that is propagated and replicated between the servers as content-addressable objects.
        These content-addressable objects can be located via both domain and distributed hash table (DHT) mechanisms.
        Each Orb witness server observes a subset of batches in the graph and includes them in their append-only logs (as Merkle Trees).
        The servers coordinate by propagating batches of DID operations and by monitoring the applicable witness servers' append-only logs.
        The Orb servers form a decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain for coordination.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document specifies the Orb DID Method along with a data model and rules for representing a graph of batches, 
        the Orb server API, a registry of protocol versions and parameters,
        an [[[ACTIVITYSTREAMS-CORE]]] vocabulary and an [[[ACTIVITYPUB]]] profile for propagating batches,
        a [[[RFC7033]]] profile for discovering endpoints, a [[[SIDETREE]]] protocol profile for encoding DID operations,
        and a [[[RFC6962]]] profile for witness logs.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Orb DID method enables users or entities to create <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/#did-uri-composition"><i>self certifying</i></a>
          decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that are propagated across a decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain for coordination.
          Decentralized identifiers [[DID-CORE]] are a fundamental building block to enable persons and entities to prove control of an identifier
          that is attached to digital objects such as Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
        </p>

        <p>
          Systems that rely on <i>self certifying</i> DIDs need a
          mechanism to propagate the ordered updates to DID documents from the operation writer to their DID resolver.
          As an example, operations can be distributed via a content-addressable network (such as <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>)
          and announced on a public blockchain (such as <a href="https://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a>) or a permissioned blockchain
          (such as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>). This DID method, instead, makes use of
          decentralized federation protocols to propagate announcements and replicate content in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">gossip manner</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As operations on DIDs can be originated by different writers in a decentralized network, it is also beneficial to enable a mechanism for determining
          the latest operations for a particular suffix. For example, when all DID operations are announced by the same blockchain, the other systems can
          monitor that blockchain for the latest operations. These blockchains can also provide relative timing in cases of 
          <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/#late-publishing">late publishing</a>. This DID method, instead, makes use of independent witness logs
          that the DID owner can associate with their DID. These witness logs can be monitored as an additional propogation source and proofs from these logs can
          also provide relative timing confidence in cases of late publishing. Rather than being a global chain of all operation announcements, these logs contain
          a subset of the announcements that propagate through the decentralized federation protocols.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          The property of <i>self certifying</i> DIDs is obtained due to Orb being an extension of the [[[SIDETREE]]] protocol.
          By using the Sidetree protocol, the DID controller forms their own verifiable chain of patches from inception to the current state of the DID document.
          These verifiable chains are included into larger batches by one of the independent Orb servers and encoded as content-addressable objects. We also
          inherit the scalability properties of the Sidetree protocol batch strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our motivation for the Orb DID method was to enable many independent organizations to create <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">
          Verifiable Data Registries</a> (VDRs) that can become connected over time.
          In designing Orb, we had the goal to enable these VDRs to interconnect into a decentralized network without the need to choose a common public
          blockchain or to rely on special-purpose consortiums to form (and remain in operation). Orb enables usage of <i>self-certifying</i> DIDs where leveraging a
          public blockchain is not acceptable but still retains the scalability properties of Sidetree batching and a decentralized network for propagating and replicating
          changes to DID documents.

        <h3>Decentralized Federation Protocols</h3>
          This DID method makes use of decentralized federation protocols to propagate announcements and replicate content in a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">gossip manner</a>. We use [[[ACTIVITYSTREAMS-CORE]]] and [[[ACTIVITYPUB]]].
          In later sections, we describe the vocabulary and profile for using these protocols in Orb.

        <h2 id="format">The did:orb Format</h2>

        <p>
            The format for the <tt>did:orb</tt> method conforms to the [[[DID-CORE]]] specification.
            The DID scheme consists of the did:orb prefix, the mechanism for discovering content-addressable objects,
            a content identifier (CID) for the minimum node in the DID operation batch graph, and the unique suffix of the DID.
        </p>
        
        <p>  
            The method uses the following ABNF [[RFC5234]] format:
        </p>

        <pre>
          did-orb-format       = "did:orb:" cas-discovery-scheme ":" 
                                 min-graph-cid ":" unique-suffix
          cas-discovery-scheme = dht-scheme / dns-scheme
          dht-scheme           = ( "ipfs" )
          dns-scheme           = "dns:" reg-name
          reg-name             = 1*idchar                ; more constrained than [RFC3986]
          min-graph-cid        = 1*idchar
          unique-suffix        = 1*idchar
        </pre>

        <p>
          See [[?RFC3986]] for the original definition of reg-name and [[DID-CORE]] for the definition of idchar.
        </p>
